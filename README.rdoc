= Uniquify

Rails gem for generating a unique token in an Active Record model.

This is from Railscasts episode #135 showing how to make a gem.

http://railscasts.com/episodes/135-making-a-gem


== Install

  gem install uniquify


== Usage

Let's say you have a Project model with a "token" string column that you 
want to be a unique identifier. Just add this to your model.

  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    uniquify :token
  end

This will generate a random and unique string before each book is 
created.

You can specify multiple columns ands options like this.

  uniquify :token, :salt, :length => 12, :chars => 0..9

You can also pass a block to generate your own characters.

  uniquify :token do
    rand(99999)
  end

If the generated value already exists, the block will be run again 
until the value is unique.
